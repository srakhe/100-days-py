Understand colour moods and what to use where.
    For example,
        Yellow grabs attention.
        Green is for edible things, food vendors use this.
        Blue is for trust and stability, banks and crypto vendors use this.

    Use this to find what colour scheme to use.
    Use monochromatic for, say navigation bars and buttons.
    Use complementary for attention grabbing things. => Do NOT use this on text and text background, only logos!

Fonts matter!
    Broad classes: Serif

    Serif has feet under each letter since it was used on stones using carving.
        Serif looks more authoritative and old timer.
        Should be used on things such as formal letters, etc.
            => Old Style, Transitional, Modern

    Serif moods:
        Serif = Traditional, Stable, Respectable.
        Sans-serif = Sensible, Simple, Straightforward.
        Script = Personal, Creative, Elegant.
        Display = Friendly, Loud, Amusing.
        Modern = Stylish, Chic, Smart.

        Sans Serif is more readable. [Humanist]

    Stick to 2 fonts/ website. They should have similar moods and time era.
    Use weights!
    Serifness is important.

UI Design:
    Hierarchies:
        Colours!
        Use dimmer colours for less important things on the page.
        Size matters when it comes to hierarchy!

    Layout:
        40 - 60 chars/line
        Alignment: Has to be consistent!
        Reduce the number of grid lines that are used for alignment!
        Simplicity is the key! Inject whitespace between different content!
        Design should fit the audience.

UX Design:
    Ease of use:
        As in the example of pavements on a lawn at a university, the UX should've taken over the Design.
        UX should make things easier for the user and not let the design hinder the ease-of-use!

    Simplicity:
        Design should be consistent. For example, navigation bars shouldn't change positions on different parts of the website.
        The user will have to re-learn everything.

    Reading Patterns:
        Use F layout
        Or Z pattern (depends if page has video/image)

    No too many warnings, banners or cookie popups!

    Scaling:
        Website should scale well in both cases,
            when going from big screen to small and visa-versa!

    Avoid dark patterns! [Trickery]
