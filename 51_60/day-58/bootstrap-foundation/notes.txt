Stuff to remember in bootstrap:

# Rows and columns (grids):
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-6">
This will create a row with a column that covers half of the row.
1 row has 12 parts and the col-md-6 denotes 6/12 parts covered.

# Containers:
# 2 types: Simple Container and Fluid Container

Simple container jumps in sizes whereas the fluid container always occupies 100% of the screen!

<div class="container-fluid">

# Buttons:
